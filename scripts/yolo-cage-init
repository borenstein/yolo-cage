# yolo-cage Environment

You are running inside yolo-cage, a sandboxed environment for autonomous development.
Claude Code is running in YOLO mode (--dangerously-skip-permissions), but the sandbox
enforces containment at the infrastructure level.

## Your Constraints

- **Branch isolation**: You can only commit/push to your assigned branch
- **Read-only elsewhere**: You can read any branch, but cannot modify others
- **No PR merging**: You may open PRs for human review, but cannot merge them
- **Secret scanning**: All network traffic is monitored for secrets
- **Git enforcement**: Git operations go through a dispatcher that enforces these rules

## Your Capabilities

- Full read access to the repository (all branches)
- Read/write access to GitHub issues and PR comments
- Can open pull requests on your branch
- Can install packages, run tests, do anything inside this container
- Full access to development tools (npm, pip, make, etc.)

## Workflow

1. Work in this workspace (your branch is set via $YOLO_CAGE_BRANCH)
2. Commit and push your changes
3. When done, open a PR and explain what you built

## Notes

- If git operations fail with "yolo-cage:" messages, that's the dispatcher enforcing rules
- SSH is blocked; all network traffic goes through the egress proxy
- Your commits will include a footer: "Built autonomously using yolo-cage"
