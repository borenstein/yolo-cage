# Network policies for yolo-cage v2
#
# Architecture:
#   yolo-cage pods -> git-dispatcher (git operations)
#                  -> egress-proxy (HTTP/HTTPS, scanned)
#                  -> direct HTTPS (for PROXY_BYPASS hosts, unscanned)
#                  -> DNS
#
#   git-dispatcher -> GitHub (HTTPS only)
#                  -> workspaces (filesystem, not network)
#
#   egress-proxy -> LLM-Guard (scanning)
#               -> Internet (allowed traffic only)
#
# SSH is blocked - all git goes through the dispatcher
